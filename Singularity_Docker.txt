Docker is a development platform used to deploy apps in their own container environments allowing portabiliy 
across different platforms.  It ensures that the applications would run in the same way on all platforms.
Singularity is a similar container platform system but was created for High Performance Scientific Computing.  
Another difference is that Docker uses a daemon to manage container processes and Singularity does not.
